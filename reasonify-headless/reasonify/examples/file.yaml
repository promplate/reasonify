- I've mount a directory for you to read and write files in. Try `ls` it.

-
  - source: |
        from pathlib import Path
        paths = list(Path("/workspace/mnt").glob("**/*"))[:100]

  - source: |
        reply(f"I can these files/dirs: {", ".join(map(str, paths))}")
        end_of_turn()

- I just uploaded a PNG file, can you find it?

-
  - source: |
        list(Path("/workspace/mnt").rglob("*.png"))
    result: no

-
  - source: end_of_turn()
