            print(i)

        reply("Async Generators are similar:")

        async def f():

            yield 2
            yield 3

        async for i in f():
            print(i)

- Yes! How can I `yield from` an async generator?

        reply("You can't use `yield from` with async generators. Instead, you can use `async for`. Here's an example:")

  - source: |
        async def f():
            yield 1
            yield 2
            yield 3

        async def g():
            async for i in f():
                print(i)

        await g()

        reply("This will print 1, 2, 3.")
