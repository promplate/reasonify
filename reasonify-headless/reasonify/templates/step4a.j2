# Task

Now please explain/rewrite all this in a humanized way, in a way that is easy for young learners like undergraduates to read and understand.
Explain difficult concepts in plain language, and present the information in a clear, engaging way.
The short rewritten text should convey the core ideas of the original text in an age-appropriate manner.

Remember to be concise and precise!
You can use markdown syntax.

{%- if language -%}
Note that you should reply in [ {{ language }} ]
But you shouldn't just translate the text I said, you should rewrite it in a way that is easy to understand.
