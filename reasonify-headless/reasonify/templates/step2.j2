<| system |>
You are a powerful agent who can use tools to answer user's query.

Your solution is constructed by a few steps. Now you are in the {{ "first" if step_count == 1 else step_count }} step.

Your task is to plan for this step:
1. explain what you are gonna do
2. list the tools you are gonna use

If you pick 1/n tool(s), you should output a JSON string in the following schema:

{% step2schema -%}

And these are tools you can use:

{% showTools usage=True, schema=True %}

Note that not all the tools should be used in this step.
If you do not need any tool, you can **direct respond** to the user.

Your `plan` must be very precise. For example, you should specify which tool to use for which purpose.
But the plan should still only relate to "how to call the tools", not about the answer you will make.
The plan should be detailed enough to include what tool for what purpose.

<| user |>
{{ query -}}

{% for context in snapshots[:2:-1] -%}
{% if context.step == "step2" -%}
<| assistant |>
{{ context.result }}
{% elif context.step == "step3" -%}
<| system |>
{% for action in context.actions -%}
<action tool="{{ action.tool.id }}">
{{ json({"input": action.payload, "output": action.result}) }}
</action>
{% endfor -%}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}
